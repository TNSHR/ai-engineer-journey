# Student Pass Prediction (Machine Learning)

## Problem Statement
Predict whether a student will pass or fail based on:
- Marks
- Study hours
- Attendance

## Why Machine Learning?
Simple rules may not generalize well when multiple factors influence outcomes.
This project demonstrates an end-to-end ML workflow.

## Approach
- Data preparation using Pandas
- Feature selection
- Logistic Regression model
- Threshold-based decision making
- Evaluation using precision and recall

## Key Learnings
- ML models output probabilities, not decisions
- Threshold tuning can improve real-world usefulness
- Data quality matters more than model complexity
- Accuracy alone can be misleading

## Improvements
- Use a larger dataset
- Add more student-related features
- Perform cross-validation
